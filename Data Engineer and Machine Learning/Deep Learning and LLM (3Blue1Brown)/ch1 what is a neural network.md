machine learning structure: **neural network**

multilayer



neuron: thing that hold a number (between 0 and 1)

number is called "**activation**"

input layer -- "hidden layer" -- output layer

activation in one layer determine the activation in the next layer



Why the layers?

divide and conquer

how are layers connected?

**weights**

sigmoid function (logistic curve) to map the value to the range [0, 1]

**bias**: only activate when above some threshold



Learning: Finding the right weights and biases



neuron: ~~thing that hold a number (between 0 and 1)~~

hold a function that maps parameters in the input layer to the output
