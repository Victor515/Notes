# Data Engineering Explained

1. Data engineering is the development, implementation, and maintenance of **systems and processes** that take in raw data and produce **high-quality**, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning. Data engineering is the intersection of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.
2. A data engineer manages the **data engineering lifecycle**, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.
3. History doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes. -- Mark Twain
4. three Vs of data: velocity, variety, and volume
5. AWS created an ultra-flexible pay-as-you-go resource marketplace by virtualizing and reselling vast pools of commodity hardware.
6. Big data engineers are now simply data engineers.
7. The data engineer we discuss in this book can be described more precisely as a **data lifecycle engineer**.
8. Although many data scientists are eager to build and tune ML models, the reality is an estimated 70% to 80% of their time is spent toiling in the bottom three parts of the [hierarchy](https://hackernoon.com/the-ai-hierarchy-of-needs-18f111fcc007)
9. A data engineer typically does **not** directly build ML models, create reports or dashboards, perform data analysis, build key performance indicators (KPIs), or develop software applications
10. My reading on **data maturity**: Different companies/orgs have different levels of data maturity, and the focus of data engineers depend heavily on the data maturity model.
11. **Getting quick wins will establish the importance of data** within the organization. Just keep in mind that quick wins will likely create technical debt.
12. **The main bottleneck for scaling** is not cluster nodes, storage, or technology but the data engineering team.
13. We suggest paying close attention to organizational hierarchies, who reports to whom, how people interact, and which silos exist. These observations will be invaluable to your success
14. **Data engineers remain software engineers**, in addition to their many other roles.
15. We believe that competent data engineers should be **highly proficient in SQL**
16. JavaScript has proven popular as a language for user-defined functions in cloud data warehouses
17. Once a new technology rolls over you, if you’re not part of the steamroller, you’re part of the road. -- Stewart Brand
18. Business never sleeps, and business stakeholders often have a significant backlog of things they want to address and new initiatives they want to launch. **Project managers** must filter a long list of requests and prioritize critical deliverables to keep projects on track and better serve the company.
