# Lesson 2 Shell Tools and Scripting

 

1. special signs in command line

   $0

   $1-9

   $_

   !!

   `""` will expand dollar signs while `''` won't

2. $? and error code of a command

   || and &&

3. a simple program

   $#:  number of arguments

   $$: process id

   $@: expand to all arguments

   `> /dev/null 2> /dev/null`: discard standard output and standard error

4.  a simplified  version of `man`: `tldr`

5. `find` : a powerful tool to find stuff, but also do stuff

6. `rg`: ripgrep, a better and efficent version of `grep`

7. `history`:  search your own history of commands

8. `fzf`: fuzzy, interactive search in command line

9. tools to quickly do directory listing and navigation:

   `ls -R`

   `tree`

   `broot`
