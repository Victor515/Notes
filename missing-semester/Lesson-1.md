1. path

   absolute path vs relative path

   `pwd`: printing working directory

   `cd`: change directory

   `.` and `..`

   `~`: home directory

   `cd -`: go back to previous directory

2. `ls -l` and file/dir permission

   r:

   w:

   x:

3.  `mv` , `cp`, `rm`, and `mkdir`

   `rm` is not recursive by default

4.  chain programs together

   input stream and output stream

    `<`: rewire input

   ` >`: rewire output

   `>>`: append

   `|`:  "pipe"

5. root user (user_id = 0)

   `sudo`: run the following program as root

   `sudo su`: open a root terminal

   `tee`: output to a file as well as standard output

6. `find`

7. `xdg-open`: open a file in its appropriate program
